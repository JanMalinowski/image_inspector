We supose that there are three major problems with our alghoritms:\n- On some images there are hair\n- Some images were made witha  miscroscope, so an aperture can be seen on the image.\n- Some people's skin is more pink than others.\n\nFixing this issue may help us to improve the classifier. However, are all of these things equally important?
